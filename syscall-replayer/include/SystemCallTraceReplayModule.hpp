 * This header file provides basic members and functions used internally

 *
 * SystemCallTraceReplayerModule is an abstract class that has basic members
 * and functions of a system call.  It can be extended to implement any
 * specific system call.  For example, open, read, write, etc.
 *
 * INITIALIZATION AND USAGE
 * As part of the abstraction design, implementing a module that replays
 * a system call requires a class to extend this abstract class and implement
 * abstract function - processRow().
