*******************************************************************************
			 TRACE-REPLAYER
*******************************************************************************

* INTRODUCTION
===============================================================================

The Trace Replayer is a tracing tool that is intended for extracting traces
of any program or an application and then replaying their I/O behavior.  It
uses DataSeries, a binary format which provides a fast and efficient way to
store and analyze traces.  Our trace replayer follows SNIA's specification
documents -- "POSIX System-Call Trace Common Semantics" and "IO Trace Common
Semantics" -- which describe the system call fields, their types, and their
values.

The replayer can be used as a benchmarking tool to measure and reproduce the
I/O performance under various workloads, or for analyzing the program traces
for security purposes, etc.

* DESIGN OVERVIEW
===============================================================================

The trace replayer is divided into three parts:

1. reanimator-strace
2. strace2ds library
3. syscall-replayer

1. reanimator-strace:

This program is used to capture system calls traces using the Linux utility
strace.  It calls Dataseries APIs which allows it to create a Dataseries
file and add records to it.

2. strace2ds-library:

The strace2ds-library is a wrapper class which allows us to link a C++
program (the DataSeries APIs) to a C program (strace code).  It contains the
definitions of functions which create DataSeries file, add a new record to
it, set the field values in a record, and finally, flush all the records to
the output Dataseries file.

3. syscall-replayer:

The program syscall-replayer is a program that is designed to replay and
analyze the system call traces collected in the DataSeries format.

* GENERAL WORKFLOW
===============================================================================

Our workflow consists of the following steps to convert a system call trace
to a DataSeries file and then replay it.

1. Define a field table for system calls in a special format and generate
XML files from it.  The table is used by generate-xml.sh script to generate
XML files describing extent types in the DataSeries file.  For our purposes,
each system call has its own extent type.

USAGE: ./generate_xml.sh <snia_table_filename>
EXAMPLE: ./generate_xml.sh tables/snia_table_fields.table

NOTE: See section below titled "FIELD TABLE" for more info.

2. Once the field table is defined and XML files are generated, run the
STRACE utility with the -X <dataseries_output_file> command line option to
capture traces and create DataSeries file.

USAGE: STRACE2DS=~/strace2ds ./strace -X foo.ds <input_program> <program_args>
EXAMPLE: STRACE2DS=~/strace2ds ./strace -X foo.ds /bin/ls -la

3. Once the DataSeries file is generated, run the system call replayer to
replay the traced program and/or analyze the trace.

USAGE: ./system-call-replayer <dataseries_input_file>
EXAMPLE: ./system-call-replayer foo.ds

NOTE: remember to add -f option if you want to trace child processes as they
are created by currently traced processes as a result of the fork system
call.

* COMMAND LINE OPTIONS OF SYSCALL REPLAYER
===============================================================================

The syscall-replayer supports the following optional command line options:

1.  -V [ --version ]	  Print version of system call replayer
2.  -h [ --help ]	  Produce help message
3.  -v [ --verbose ]	  System calls replay in verbose mode
4.  --verify		  Verifies that the data being written/read is exactly
				what was used originally
5.  -w [ --warn ] arg	  System call replays in warn mode
6.  -p [ --pattern ] arg  Write repeated pattern data for write, pwrite, and
				writev system call

* WARN LEVELS OF SYSCALL REPLAYER
===============================================================================

The syscall-replayer program has 3 modes:

1. DEFAULT MODE (0)

In this mode, the replayer ignores any error or warning messages while
running, and continues to replay records.  This is the default to run the
syscall-replayer program.

USAGE: ./system-call-replayer -w 0 foo.ds
USAGE: ./system-call-replayer foo.ds

2. WARN MODE (1)

In this mode, if the replayed data (return values, error numbers, read/write
data, etc.) is different from the data recorded in the DataSeries trace
file, the program outputs a warning message.

USAGE: ./system-call-replayer -w 1 foo.ds

3. ABORT MODE (2)

In this mode, the replayer simply aborts if the replayed data is different
from the data recorded in the DataSeries trace file.

USAGE: ./system-call-replayer -w 2 foo.ds

#EZK: is just if data is different, or also when a syscall returns error
#that wasn't expected?

* WRITE PATTERN OF SYSCALL REPLAYER
===============================================================================

The syscall-replayer program supports writing the following patterns of data
when replaying write-related system calls such as write, pwrite, and writev.

NOTE: Unless otherwise specified using the -p option below, if the
DataSeries trace contains the data written by the traced program, then that
data will be written instead of using one of the following patterns.

#EZK: what happens if -p not given and DS file does NOT have the original
#data written?  Is it even possible to get into that situation?

1. WRITING ZEROS

In this mode, the replayer fills the write buffer with zeros.

USAGE: ./system-call-replayer -p 0 foo.ds

2. WRITING PATTERN

In this mode, the replayer fills the write buffer with a pattern.

USAGE: ./system-call-replayer -p "0x5" foo.ds

3. WRITING RANDOM

In this mode, the replayer fills the write buffer with random values.

USAGE: ./system-call-replayer -p "random" foo.ds

* FIELD TABLE
===============================================================================

The field table describes the information fields and their types for each
system call that will constitute our target DataSeries file.  The table has
four fields, delimited by '\t':

1. the name of the extent
2. the name of the field
3. whether the field is nullable (1) or not nullable (0)
4. the type of the field

Nullable fields are ones that don't have to be specified (i.e., they are
optional).  Non-nullable fields are mandatory and must be specified.

For fields common to every system call, the extent name is "Common".  All
the common fields are nullable except 'unique_id' which uniquely identifies
each record across all extents in the DataSeries file.

Example: Read and Write system calls

$ cat example.table
Common  time_called     1       int64
Common  time_returned   1       int64
Common  time_recorded   1       int64
Common  executing_pid   1       int32
Common  executing_tid   1       int32
Common  executing_ppid  1       int32
Common  executing_uid   1       int32
Common  errno_number    1       int32
Common  errno_string    1       variable32
Common  return_value    1       int64
Common  unique_id       0       int64
read    descriptor      0       int32
read    buffer_ptr      1       int64
read    bytes_requested 0       int64
read    data_read       1       variable32
write   descriptor      0       int32
write   buffer_ptr      1       int64
write   bytes_requested 0       int64
write   data_written    1       variable32

* DESIGN ISSUES IN CREATING DATASERIES FILE
===============================================================================

The previous version of trace replayer involves the following steps to
create a DataSeries file:

1. Capture strace's direct output in human readable format to create a
   <test.sys> file.
2. Convert <test.sys> file to an intermediate CSV file containing the
   relevant system call fields.
3. Finally, convert intermediate CSV file to a DataSeries file.

Strace's direct output was post-processed, missing vital information, and
hard to parse.  The CSV file was also difficult to parse and was
insufficient to store non-ASCII characters, multiple records, and more.
This resulted in losing important information about the traced program.

Therefore, for the latest version of syscall-replayer, we chose to modify
strace code directly in order to capture the raw data and generate the
DataSeries file directly from strace.

* DESIGN DECISIONS IN FSL-STRACE
===============================================================================

1. COMMON FIELDS AND V_ARGS

The DataSeries API is callable from strace.  To add a new record call this:

void ds_write_record(DataSeriesOutputModule *ds_module,
		     const char *extent_name,
		     long *args,
		     void *common_fields[DS_NUM_COMMON_FIELDS],
		     void **v_args);

@param ds_module	: object of DataSeriesOutputModule class
@param extent_name	: denotes the name of the system call
@param args		: pointer to the arguments of system call (member of
			  struct tcb, see below)
@param common_fields	: array of pointers to store common field values
@param v_args		: array of pointers to store virtual arguments

Strace maintains a Trace Control Block (TCB, or struct *tcb, see defs.h in
strace code for complete structure) which stores parameters passed to a
system call and other metadata such as executing pid, error code, return
values, time called, time returned, etc.

1.1. COMMON FIELDS and ARGS MAP

Instead of passing individual common field values in ds_write_record(), we
chose to create an array of pointers named common_fields.  We store the
addresses of common fields in the common_fields.  Then we pass the array to
strace2ds's library API, so that it can deference the pointer to extract
their values.  The reason why we use pointers, rather than actual values, is
because ARGS_MAP uses common_fields to extract common field values and
ARGS_MAP holds the addresses of field values.  ARGS_MAP uses pointers rather
than values because we want to have uniform interface for all data types,
avoid creating too many strace2ds library APIs, in order for strace to talk
to strace2ds's library more easily, and avoid passing too many arguments
around.  For example, a system call argument could be a string, an int,
double, struct, struct pointer, int pointer, buffer, etc.  To pass those
values to strace2ds, we would have to create different APIs in strace2ds's
for every possible combination; using a pointer to the value makes the
access uniform instead.

1.2. V_ARGS

Arguments such as pathname or read/write buffers passed to system calls
cannot be referenced directly from tcp->u_args.  These arguments are copied
from the address space of the actual process being traced and stored in an
array of pointers named as v_args, which is passed to ds_write_record().

2. UTILITY FUNCTIONS

We added several utility functions in the strace code file util.c to copy
the arguments from the address space of the actual process being traced.
These utility functions internally call the strace utility functions
umoven() or umovestr() to copy the buffers and string pathnames,
respectively.

3. TRACE CAPTURING POINT

We are collecting traces of each system call in trace_syscall_exiting(),
defined in the strace code file syscall.c.  Strace fills the TCB structure
before calling trace_syscall_exiting() except for the time returned value.
The time returned value is recorded inside trace_syscall_exiting() function.

#EZK: where do we mention exceptions, syscalls that cannot be captured at
#_exiting()?

4. STRACE NUMBER DUPLICATION: XATTR AND KILL-RELATED SYSTEM CALLS HANDLING

Strace uses its own system call numbering scheme, whose structure is
defined in sysent.h.  The numbering is architecture dependent and defined in
linux/<architecture>/syscallent.h.  This numbering scheme is non-unique, and
assigns the same number (tcp->s_ent->sen) to the following closely related
system calls:

a. setxattr and lsetxattr
b. getxattr and lgetxattr
c. removexattr and lremovexattr
d. listxattr and llistxattr
e. exit_group and exit
f. tkill and kill

Therefore, using `sen' to identify system calls is unreliable in these cases
to uniquely detect the system call.  Therefore, we added an extra check,
using the system call name (tcp->s_ent->sys_name).  To avoid expensive
string comparison, we check the first different character of the system call
name to identify invoked system call.

Example 1:

For the combinations a, b, and c above, we distinguish between the system
calls by checking whether the first character in the system call name is an
'l':

if (tcp->s_ent->sys_name[0] == 'l')
	/* handling for l*xattr system call */
else
	/* handling for other system call */

Example 2:

For the combination d, we distinguish between the system calls by checking
whether the second character in the system call name is an 'l':

if (tcp->s_ent->sys_name[1] == 'l')
	/* handling for llistxattr system call */
else
	/* handling for listxattr system call */

Example 3:

For the combination f, we distinguish between the system calls by checking
whether the first character in the system call name is an 't':

if (tcp->s_ent->sys_name[0] == 't')
	/* handling for tkill system call */
else
	/* handling for kill system call */

* DESIGN DECISIONS IN STRACE2DS
===============================================================================

1. UMASK SYSTEM CALLS

The traced application has a default umask value that is different from the
replayer.  Therefore, we need to change the umask value of the replayer to
be the same as the traced application.  Unfortunately, there is no system
call that allows us to extract a umask value directly.  Instead, we have to
call umask(2) twice in order to get the correct umask value.  The first call
is to get the original value of mask value (while setting it to some dummy
value); the second call is to restore the mask value.  Therefore, we need to
generate one umask record at the very beginning of the DataSeries trace
output file.  By doing so, our replayer will replay the umask record at
first and sets its umask value to be same as the traced application.

Note: We generate all DataSeries trace files that have an umask at the very
beginning as version 1.0.  The replayer checks the version number and ensure
it has such a special umask value as the first record.

#EZK verify last sentence

* DESIGN DECISIONS IN SYSCALL REPLAYER
===============================================================================

1. FILE DESCRIPTORS MAPPING

Problem:

A. Reading/Writing from/to a file happens using a fd (file descriptor).  The
   fd returned from the open system call, in the program that we want to
   trace, is called the "traced fd" and the fd returned from the open system
   call in our replayer is called the "replayed fd".  Although the traced
   program and the replayer can execute the open system call with exactly
   the same arguments, the kernel may return different fds.  Therefore, the
   traced fd and the replayed fd may not be same.  To correctly replay
   (e.g., writing data to a correct file), we cannot simply take the traced
   fd and feed it into the write system call.  Instead, we need a way to
   translate the traced fd into its corresponding replayed fd whenever we
   see a system call that uses any fd.

B. A trace program can invoke process-creation related system calls to
   create processes.  However, for simplicity, our replayer is currently a
   single process.  It doesn't invoke any process-creation related system
   calls to simulate process creation/deletion/update behaviors of the
   traced program.  Therefore, in order for replayer to correctly simulate
   the same behavior of traced program (producing same output), we need a
   way to manage fds for all processes in the traced program.

Solution:

To translate a traced fd into its corresponding replayed fd, we maintain a
mapping between the file descriptors of the traced program and the replayer.
This solves problem "A" above because every time we encounter a traced fd,
we use the mapping to get replayed fd to use.  However, this mapping doesn't
help us in problem "B" because our mapping is one-to-one (one traced fd to
one replayed fd) and fds in multi-processes are one-to-many (one traced fd
to many replayed fds).  For example, process A has fd 1 that points to file
"foo" and process B has fd 1 that points to file "bar".  Our replayer has
two distinct fds for this.  To solve this, we add another mapping layer
around fd mapping.

We implemented an fd-manager, a data structure that has this layer structure
and manages all activities that are related to fds.  The first layer maps a
process id to a process file descriptors table.  This means that each
process in the traced program has its own file descriptors table in our
fd-manager.  The file descriptors table is the fd mapping where a traced fd
is the key and the value is a tuple of replayed fd and flags.

Let's say we have process id 1234 performing the following sequence of
system calls in tracing:

a. Open file1 (say this returns fd 60)
b. Open file2 (say this returns fd 65)
c. read(60)

While replaying:

a. Open file1 (say this returns fd 90)

In tracing, process #1234 opened file1 which returned fd 60.  So, in
replaying we add an entry <1234, <60,90>> to the map (fd-manager).  Here the
key is pid 1234 and the value is also a map <traced_fd, replayed_fd>.

b. Open file2 (say this returns fd 100)

Same as above, we add an entry <1234, <65,100>> to the fd-manager.

c. read(90) (read(60) gets converted to read(90) using mapping <1234, <60,90>>)

The trace file says process 1234 and fd 60, so we use the fd-manager and get
fd 90.  This mapping is needed for each process as each process has its own
list of fds.  Thus, the fd-manager data structure should look something
like: this

Map<int process, Map<int traced_fd, tuple<int replayed_fd, int flags>>>

2. INTEGER ENCODING OF FLAG AND MODE VALUES

Our converter and replayer follow the SNIA specification document, "POSIX
System Call Trace Common Semantics".  The document requires system call
traces to store individual flag and mode bits.  However, storing the integer
encoding of flag and mode values is optional since the individual bits can
be used to construct integer encoding values.  When our strace2ds-library
converts the information gathered from strace to DataSeries, it stores both
the original integer encoding of the mode (optional, or nullable) as well as
all the individual bits (mandatory, or non-nullable) in the DataSeries
output file.

We chose to store both fields because we want our replayer to be fast.
Encoding a mode/flag value as an integer from the integer bits would add
overhead to the replayer, when it has to reconstruct the original
mode/flags.  Storing both values also gives users the flexibility to extract
any data that they want.  Even though the DataSeries files that our
converter produces contain individual bits, all of our replaying modules
extract only the integer encoding value from the DataSeries file since the
modules are not using individual bits for replay.  A modification to the
replaying modules would be required to extract those bits.

One useful example is the open system call.  Its mode value is passed as an
integer encoding and the individual mode bits are mode_R_user, mode_W_user,
etc.  Our open call replay module only extracts the mode_value_ field.  It
doesn't support fields for the individual bits even though the DataSeries
trace file contains those individual mode bits.

3. ROWS PER CALL

Some system calls such as readv, writev, and execve require multiple rows to
be processed to replay a single system call.  So the 'rows_per_call_' field
was added in the base class SystemCallTraceReplayModule.  Its default value
is 1, because most system calls can be defined with a single DataSeries
record.  If a system call requires multiple rows to process, then
rows_per_call_ should be set to the number of rows that must be processed.

After a system call is replayed, we increment the series pointer in the
ExtentSeries of that particular system call by the value set in the
'row_per_call_' field.

4. NON REPLAYABLE SYSTEM CALLS

There are several system calls that we do not replay for various reasons.
Therefore, we typically just simply return from the processRow() function of
these particular system calls without actually executing them.

For example, we don't replay _exit because it would terminate the replayer.

We don't replay mmap, munmap, and their related calls as of now, because
there's no way for a ptrace(2)-ed process to capture the memory-mapped
activity of a process (which is handled by the MMU directly).

We don't replay fork, clone, and execve.  That is because, for now, we chose
to have our replayer simpler and single threaded.  However, we do perform
special processing in or FD-map (see section XXX above/below) during these
process management calls, as well as during _exit.

We don't replay setsid and setpgid, because our replayer is a single process
and executing these two system calls will not have any side-effects.

We don't replay socket, instead, we add a special entry to to the FD-map, to
denote that a traced FD is a socket being emulated (SYSCALL_SIMULATED).  Any
subsequent system call on any such (emulated) socket FD will not be
replayed.  The traced return value will be returned.  Additionally, we
suppress data verification for any operation on simulated socket FDs.

#EZK: Say how we "fake" _exit: do we check any return value or passed value
#at all?  What do we do, if any to mmap/etc.?  And we do have special
#handling for fork/clone/execve, esp. wrt the fd-map.  Need details.

#EZK: it's odd to describe exit/execve here and also in more detail below.
#Ideally we should describe them in one place.

5. UMASK SYSTEM CALL

#EZK: we need to describe this very important design decision, that we chose
#to make the replayer single threaded (at least for now).  And this needs to
#be described in the context of the fd-map design, and then we explain why
#we don't replay fork/clone/execve, and how that design decision impacted
#FDs and umask.

Because our replayer is a single-process and the traced application can be
multi-process, we need to manage umask values on our own.  We use umask(0)
to "turn off" umask, meaning we make it the least restrictive mask for newly
created files.  This is needed because the kernel still has to have some
umask value.  We record the umask value of the traced process, any changes
to it (if the traced program called umask directly), and any mode values
passed to calls like open, create, or mkdir.  By default the umask of the
user running the replayer is used, and applied to whatever mode values we
pass to syscalls like mkdir(path, mode).  Essentially, the kernel will not
modify the mode values that we pass to system calls.  Thus whatever mode we
pass to mkdir() will take place.  The replayer calculates the precise mode
value to pass to calls like mkdir and open, and passes it; by setting
umask(0) in the replayer, we ensure that the kernel will effectively use the
exact mode value we want, and thus faithfully reproduce the original system
call's behavior.

#EZK: above description of umask algorithm was lacking.  Revised a lot.
#Please review and verify with code; ensure this is clear enough.

6. MULTI-THREADED SUPPORT IN TRACE-REPLAY

Since strace is a Linux-only utility, we are currently supporting only the
Linux operating system.

In linux:

A. Creating a new thread is cloning a process with the CLONE_FILES flag.
B. Creating a new process is cloning a process with or without that flag.

Correspondingly, in Linux, the tid and pid are equivalent.  When the traced
process creates a new thread, the traced 'pid' in the tcb block in strace is
actually the 'tid' (thread ID).  In our replayer, we have this pid based
resources mapping table, the fd-manager.  Currently, these resources are fd
and umask values.  During replaying, if we encounter a CLONE_FILES flag in
the clone system call, we assign its parent FD mapping table to the child
and make them share the same table.  Conversely, in the case when there is
no CLONE_FILES flag, the child would have its own FD mapping table with the
same content of its parent table but not shared.  To create such a deep copy,
we call dup(2) on all entries of the parent table.  To ensure that the
fd-manager does not have any unused entries, we remove the entries from the
resources mapping table for the processes that get terminated or killed.
The fd-manager can therefore consistently handle replaying multi-threaded
programs.

* SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS IN DATASERIES SYSTEM CALL TRACE FILE
===============================================================================

The replayer will support only DataSeries trace files that have versions >=
1.0 since DataSeries system call trace files with >= 1.0 version have the
special aforementioned umask record at the beginning.

* SOME SPECIAL SYSTEM CALLS
===============================================================================

1. READV AND WRITEV

The readv and writev system calls can read and write arbitrarily many
buffers.  The extent type in DataSeries file should be of fixed length.  To
handle this, multiple records are added to the DataSeries trace file when a
readv or writev call is traced.

Records are identified and ordered by an 'iov_number'.  The first record
only sets the fields for the descriptor and the count and has a special iov
number equal to '-1'.  A separate record is added for each buffer passed to
the readv or writev system call.  Each of these subsequent records has an
increasing iov_number, starting with '0'.

2. EXECVE

The execve system call can accept an arbitrary number of arguments and
environment variables.  Since the extent type in a DataSeries file cannot
handle variable length rows, multiple records are added to the DataSeries
trace file when an execve call is traced.

Records are identified and ordered by a 'continuation_number'.  The first
record only sets the fields for the pathname and has a special continuation
number equal to '0'.  A separate record is added for each argument and
environment variable passed to the execve system call.  Each of these
subsequent records has an increasing continuation_number starting with '1'.

We capture the parameters of an execve system call in the
trace_syscall_entering() function rather than in trace_syscall_exiting()
function (see syscall.c in the strace code).  This is because the execve
system call does not return upon success and the memory segments of the
calling process are overwritten by that of the newly loaded program.

As described above, recall that in the trace_syscall_exiting() function, we
only capture the common field values.  Since the common field values are
captured last, after the arguments and environment variables, a new record
containing just the common fields is added to the DataSeries file with a
special continuation_number equal to '-1'.

3. EXIT

We capture the parameters of an _exit system call in the
trace_syscall_entering() function rather than in the trace_syscall_exiting()
function (see syscall.c in the strace code).  This is because for the _exit
system call, trace_syscall_exiting() function is not called.

Also, since the _exit system call does not return, we do not set
time_returned, return values, or errno numbers in the syscall-replayer.

#EZK: so do we set those 3 fields to anything, or are they nullable?

4. FSTATAT

The underlying system call employed by the glibc fstatat() wrapper function
is actually called fstatat64() or, on some architectures, newfstatat().  In
reanimator-strace, we intercept this system call using the 'SEN_newfstatat' switch
block.  While recording we create a new record for the fstatat system call
in the DataSeries file.  Finally, while replaying, instead of calling
newfstatat(), we call the fstatat() system call.

You will need to understand how Dataseries works (how it is laid out), and
how to use it.  You can refer to the following links to understand how it

* WHERE IS THE CODE?

Our code for both strace and reanimator-library is on git.

1. strace:

git clone https://github.com/SNIA/reanimator-strace.git 

2. reanimator-library:

git clone https://github.com/SNIA/reanimator-library.git 

* WHERE TO WORK?

Any development you do should be done on a virtual machine, and only real
experiments are run on actual machines.  You could use one of FSL virtual
machines and ESX servers.  You can also use your own virtual machine, but it
will be easier to use an FSL VM since a lot of things are already installed
there.

We have installed the DataSeries library on the 'trex' machine in FSL.  So,
you do not need to install DS on your individual FSL VM.

* HOW TO BUILD?

After you have both the git repositories mentioned above, you have to build
the project, to see how it works:

1. First, prepare the strace2ds library:

a. Change your working directory to strace2ds-library:

$ cd reanimator-library/strace2ds-library

b. Run "./buildall".  This should make a strace2ds directory in your HOME
folder and setup the reanimator strace2ds library in your account:

$ ./buildall

2. Now you can build the replayer:

a. Change your working directory to strace2ds-replayer

$ cd reanimator-library/syscall-replayer

b. Run "make".  This should allow you to build the whole replayer project

$ make

3. To build the trace module:

a. Change your working directory to reanimator-strace

$ cd reanimator-strace

b. Change your active branch to 'ds'.  'ds' is the main working branch of
FSL for the tracer module

$ git checkout ds

c. Run configure script with all DataSeries options enabled

$ ./build-reanimator-strace

d. Check the updated man page for a new -X option.  You should be able to
find the -X option nested inside of -o option.

$ man ./strace.1 | grep '\-X'

e. Verify that "Optional features" section has following entry in usage:

	[ --enable-dataseries        enable DataSeries output format ]

$ ./configure -h | grep dataseries

Note: We use --enable-dataseries in our build-reanimator-strace, configure adds
a "#define ENABLE_DATASERIES" to the code.  You can use it to ifdef stuff as
needed.   All the code we are adding/changing, should be #ifdef'ed
ENABLE_DATASERIES so it'll be easy for us to tell where our changes are.

* HOW TO RUN?

Here's an example how to run our own strace

$ cd BUILD
$ STRACE2DS=~/strace2ds ./strace -X foo.ds /bin/cat stamp-h
$ ls -l foo.ds

Now you should see foo.ds in your current directory.

Here's an example how to run syscall replayer with a trace file (foo.ds)

$ cd reanimator-library/syscall-replayer

Make sure your foo.ds is in replayer directory.

$ ./system-call-replayer foo.ds

Now replayer should starts to replay all the system call records in foo.ds

Note: If you want to compare tests between different file system,
you need to run our replayer on a file system that is in the same state as
the file system that captures the traces.  This is needed since our replayer
makes this assumption.

* HOW TO TEST?

Here's an example how to run a replayer test

$ cd reanimator-library/syscall-replayer/replayer-tests

Choose a system call that you want to test and build its corresponding program

$ gcc -o rmdir-test rmdir-test.c

Go to replayer directory

$ cd ../

Capture test program traces

$ STRACE2DS=~/strace2ds ~/reanimator-strace/BUILD/strace -f -X foo.ds ./rmdir-test

Replay the test program

$ ./system-call-replayer foo.ds
